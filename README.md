## Introduction
OSCAR-UI is a Vue.js-based user interface for the [OSCAR](https://github.com/grycap/oscar) framework. It is intended to be run inside a Kubernetes cluster in order to provide a unified web-based graphical user interface to interact with the [OSCAR Manager](https://o-scar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#architecture) and the underlying data-storage back-end (e.g. Minio).
